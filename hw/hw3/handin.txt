Problem 3:
Java uses dynamic method binding as the method being called is from the ref to the object not from the type of the variable. Assessed at runtime.

Problem 5:
a. Type in Language. Statically typed and dynamically typed language.
b. Statically typed: Type checking is performed during compile-time, variable has a specific type that can't be changed.
Dynamically typed: Type checking is performed at run-time, variable does not have a type, only values
c. Foozle uses dynamic typing
d. Banana uses static typing
