Problem 2:
  produce creates value on the heap. Consume only reassigns the pointer but never free the memory on the heap
  => Memory leak\

Problem 3:
Dangling Reference

Problem 4:
The free returns the node that the head and the tail are pointing to to the heap manager. However, head and tail are not NULL. This causes Dangling Reference.
