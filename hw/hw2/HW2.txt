1. Formal type
- int i;	i: int
- int arr[];	arr: NULL + Ref(int -> int)
- enum Color{Green, Red, Brown, Yellow};
	Color = Green + Red + Brown + Yellow
- class Leaf {
	Color color;
	int numOfVeins;
	}
	Leaf = (NULL + Ref(Color)) * int
- Leaf leaf;	leaf: NULL + Ref(Leaf)
- class MapleTree {
	float heightInFeet;
	Leaf[] leaves;
	}
	MapleTree = float * (NULL + Ref(int -> (NULL + Ref(Leaf))))

2. Java supports enum and array.
- enum:
	- Create: enum Food { SOMETHING, SOMETHINGELSE, WOW };
	- Assign: Food f = Food.SOMETHING;
	- Enum does support equality, aka you can do f == Food.SOMETHING but can't support < operation. Only valid when called on comparable things (like ordinal)
	- Can't cast enum to something else like integer.
	- Enum in Java supports ordinal, syntax: f.ordinal(), ordinal starts at 0, and in the order of the enum listed. Ordinal is fixed and contiguous
	- Enum in Java supports assign value/attribute but you have to declare it in the constructor (i.e public Food(float price) { this.price = price }). 
	- There can be multiple attributes.
	- You can add function(s) to enum in Java.

- array: (normal array not arraylist)
	- (type)[] : i.e int[] arr; (to create arr of type int[]) int[] arr = new int[size]; (for initialization)
	- Not resizable. The size is fixed with initialization.
	- Only have one type.
	- Use int as index
	- Start from 0
	- Can't add function to the mapping
	- There are some built-in functions (actually attributes) like length
	- Can make multiple dim array

- cartesian product (basically a class in java)
	- Example of creation in the code
	- There can be many components
	- There has to be a name for a class
	- Access by name
	- Function can be added

- Java builtin does not support union. The only close thing should be class inheritance (?), but then it is not really union type.

3. Enum in python:
- Create:
from enum import Enum, auto

class Fruit(Enum):
    ORANGE = auto()
    BANANA = auto()
    BLUEBERRY = auto()

- When declaring the enum, we have to specify the hidden value of the enum, even when we want to set the value to be auto.
- There are options to make the enum value distinctive (can't be repeated) (add decorator @unique)
- There are no order in enum. In other words, enum in python does not have ordinal values.
- There are still equality comparision.
- There can be built-in function.
- Enum in Python can be iterated.
